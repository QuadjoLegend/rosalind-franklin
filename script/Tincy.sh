#7.	The .fna file is actually from a bacteria, and it should definitely have a TATA (tata) box for initiating gene transcription. The molecular biologist is trying to understand the implication of dual TATA sequences. The files got mixed up and we are not sure which is wildtype and which is mutant. The mutant should have “tatatata” while the normal should have just “tata”. Can you confirm if the file is mutant or wild type
